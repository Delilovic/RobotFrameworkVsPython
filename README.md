### Difference Between Robot Framework and Python Automation (Examples)

## Introduction
To convince someone to use the Robot Framework it often takes examples that show
the differences and advantages between Robot Framework automation and Python automation.
Since I had trouble finding such examples, I posted my own examples here hoping someone
will use them and get more people excited about this great framework.

The [seleniumLogin](examples/seleniumLogin) example uses the selenium library to log in to a test web page
and check if the login was successful. For a more detailed description, please check the
seleniumLogin example [README.md](examples/seleniumLogin/README.md) file.


## Contribution
- If you would like to share more examples or improve and edit existing examples, feel free to make a commit.
- Please follow the same structure as the [seleniumLogin](examples/seleniumLogin) example and also commit a
README.md file describing what your example does and how to run it.
- It would be nice (but not mandatory) if your Robot Framework example also runs in the RIDE IDE.
- Please use Python 3.9 for the Python examples.
